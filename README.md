# Road-Accident-Analysis-Using-Power-BI

Welcome to the Road Accident Analysis project repository. This project utilizes PowerBI to analyze casualties by various factors including vehicle type, location, light condition, and urban/rural classification. The dataset contains information such as Accident Index, Date, Day of Week, Junction Control, Accident Severity, Latitude, Longitude, and more.

# Dataset Description:
The dataset includes the following information:

Accident Index,Accident Date,Day of Week,Junction Control,Junction Detail,Accident Severit,Latitude,Light Conditions,Local Authority (District),Carriageway Hazards,Longitude,Number of Casualties,Number of Vehicles,Police Force,Road Surface Conditions,Road Type,Speed Limit,Time,Urban or Rural Area,Weather Conditions,Vehicle Type

# Analysis:
We analyze casualties based on:

1. Vehicle Type
2. Location
3. Light Conditions
4. Urban/Rural Classification

# Project Structure:
